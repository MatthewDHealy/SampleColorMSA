# SampleColorMSA

This is an example of a multiple sequence alignment with Interactive Profiles and
Dynamic Color coding.

Try changing the filtering criteria by clicking on the Autofilter arrows.  Note how
the profiles and colors change to reflect the visible rows.

Take a look at each tab in the file.  Study the formulas used to build the profiles.
Note in particular how I take advantage of the fact that the Subtotal function only
considers rows that are visible, which is how I make the profiles change to reflect
filtering choices.

This was created using MS Excel, so should work in all recent versions of MS Excel.
It has also been tested in Libre Office, on a version from 2012 and on a version
from late 2017.  It worked with both, so it should work with any recent version of
Libre Office.
